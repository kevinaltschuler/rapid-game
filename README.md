# super battle cliker 5000

## Overview

this is like cookie clicker except with real time online 1v1 combat.

made in inferno cause it used to benchmark better than react. maybe react is almost as fast nowadays but i didnt check.

used firebase cause this is a prototype. also firebase is really fast and i didnt have to do any peer to peer or anything. Combat works really well actually im surprised firebase is this fast.
